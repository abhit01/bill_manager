# bill_manager

The project is developed using HTML, PHP, CSS, JAVAScript  by using Xampp. We  used special editor and Xampp for hosting sql and apache server to make our work  easier and to actively demonstrate a server - user data hierarchy on a small-scale  project level, this helped us with database creation. 
 
We have chosen to build a Web - application that will bridge the gap between the customer and seller with the use of ledger and monthly bill generation for daily household items like newspapers, milk etc. Our website will save users from the daily hassle of maintaining records for milk, newspaper on the calendar, with the help of our website one can easily manage monthly record for daily household items and can view it any time

USERS:  The user base of this app is wide and can help people manage their daily bills and  shopkeepers to maintain their daily ledger  ● Shopkeepers  ● Newspaper seller  ● Milkman  ● General stores  ● Mobile stores  ● Daily use
